# Jakky567's adblock filters
Here is a list of my custom Ublock origin filters. I take the approach that while social media is annoying sometimes, it can be useful, so I generally will not block widgets or logins or comment sections. That being said, I will have a separate list focused on privacy/speeding up webpage loading by blocking things like third party comment systems. A list of site fixes are also included as a separate list, for my policy will be to separate out the functionality where possible. I use pretty much anything, but I try to follow good practice by say evaluating regex on only specific domains, types, etc, minimal css injection (getting around certain annoyances). I also tend to scrape other lists for material to use (Dan Pollock's host file contains an organized list of shock sites that I append to my list). I'll try to give proper credit, but this is mostly hosted for my personal use.
